###Initial input:

Our current sitemaps for California Psychics, Horoscope, and Blog are outdated. They contain multiple URLs that return a 301 redirect, which negatively impacts SEO. We need to update the sitemaps to reflect the correct URLs and remove all redirects. There are many URLs that are minor syntax updates, and a few URLs that no longer exist which we need to remove.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Multi-File Testing Support (COMPLETED ✅)
• **Psychics.csv**: 492 URLs with 301 redirects - filter by status code 301, update to Expected URLs
• **Blog.csv**: 11 URLs with 301 redirects - filter by status code 301, update to Redirect URLs
• **Horoscope.csv**: 51 URLs with 301 redirects - filter by status code 301, update to Expected URLs
• Apply changes in: www.californiapsychics.com/sitemap.xml

#### Implementation Requirements (COMPLETED ✅)
• ✅ Support for multiple CSV files with different column structures
• ✅ Command-line interface for file selection (--file, --all, --env)
• ✅ Unique report generation per CSV file to prevent overwrites
• ✅ Environment switching between QA and Production


### Important clarifications (IMPLEMENTED ✅):
- ✅ **Environment Switching**: Command-line parameter `--env qa` or `--env prod`
- ✅ **QA Environment**: Auto-adds "qa-" prefix (qa-www.californiapsychics.com)
- ✅ **Multi-File Architecture**: All CSV files in "in/" folder supported
  - `in/Psychics.csv` - Primary psychic profile redirects
  - `in/Blog.csv` - Blog post redirects
  - `in/Horoscope.csv` - Horoscope page redirects
- ✅ **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new CSV files via column mapping configuration


### Task understanding (ENHANCED ✅)
- ✅ **Multi-File Support**: Test links with 301 Status Code from multiple CSV files
- ✅ **Expected Response**: 200 status code for Expected/Redirect URLs in target environment
- ✅ **Sitemap Validation**: Dual verification - Expected URLs IN sitemap + Original URLs REMOVED
- ✅ **Removal Handling**: Check URLs marked "REMOVE" are properly inaccessible
- ✅ **Column Structure Handling**: Different column structures per CSV file automatically detected

### Current Test Results Summary - UPDATED WITH CRITICAL FINDINGS ⚠️
- **Psychics.csv**: 98% URL accessibility rate (490 URLs tested), 41% sitemap compliance (287 missing in QA)
- **Blog.csv**: 100% URL accessibility rate (11 URLs tested), 81.8% sitemap compliance (2 path conflicts)
- **Horoscope.csv**: 100% URL accessibility rate (51 URLs tested), 0% sitemap compliance ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**

### 🔴 CRITICAL SITEMAP ISSUES DISCOVERED
**September 23, 2025 - Comprehensive Analysis Completed**

#### Issue #1: HOROSCOPE CONTENT COMPLETELY MISSING ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Impact**: ALL 51 horoscope URLs are ABSENT from both QA and Production sitemaps
- **Status**: Pages are accessible (200 status) but invisible to search engines
- **SEO Impact**: Entire horoscope section not discoverable by Google, Bing, etc.
- **Examples**: `/horoscope/virgo-horoscope-tomorrow/`, `/horoscope/monthly-horoscope/`, etc.
- **Resolution Required**: Add all horoscope URLs to sitemap generation immediately

#### Issue #2: QA/PRODUCTION SITEMAP MISMATCH ⚠️ HIGH
- **Impact**: 287 psychic profile URLs missing from QA but present in Production
- **Status**: QA sitemap has 1,418 URLs vs Production 1,073 URLs, but missing critical content
- **Testing Impact**: Cannot validate Production sitemap behavior in QA environment
- **Resolution Required**: Sync QA sitemap generation with Production

#### Issue #3: BLOG vs ARTICLES PATH CONFLICT ⚠️ HIGH
- **Impact**: Redirects reference `/blog/` paths but sitemaps only contain `/articles/` paths
- **Status**: Broken redirect chains in SEO structure
- **Affected**: `/blog/` root and specific blog post URLs
- **Resolution Required**: Standardize path structure (blog → articles)

### Manual Verification Confirms Issues Are Genuine
✅ **Testing tool accuracy verified** - no formatting issues
✅ **Manual curl tests performed** on both QA and Production
✅ **Raw sitemap XML analyzed** to confirm missing content
✅ **All reported issues are real sitemap gaps**, not test errors

###QA Environment Implementation Notes
**URL Handling Between Environments:**
- Test data (CSV) contains production URLs (e.g., `www.californiapsychics.com/page`)
- QA testing converts these to QA URLs (e.g., `qa-www.californiapsychics.com/page`)
- QA sitemap contains proper QA URLs with qa-www prefix
- Sitemap validation normalizes qa-www back to www for comparison with test data

**Sitemap Technical Details:**
- QA sitemap uses custom namespace: `https://qa-cdn-1.californiapsychics.com/sitemap.xml`
- Parser detects namespace dynamically from root element
- Standard sitemap namespace fallback for production environment
- Sitemap contains 1,418 URLs in QA environment

**Dual Verification Criteria:**
- **URL Accessibility**: Tests that expected URLs return 200 status
- **Sitemap Compliance**: Verifies expected URLs are IN sitemap AND original URLs are REMOVED
- **Overall Success**: Both criteria must pass for complete validation

### ⚠️ Multi-File Sitemap Analysis (UPDATED)

**Current Findings from Multi-File Testing:**

#### Psychics.csv Analysis
- **URLs tested**: 492 redirects
- **URL Accessibility**: ~99.6% success rate
- **Sitemap Compliance**: Varies by QA environment status
- **Key insight**: High URL accessibility indicates redirects are working

#### Blog.csv Analysis
- **URLs tested**: 11 redirects
- **URL Accessibility**: 100% (11/11)
- **Sitemap Compliance**: 81.8% (9/11 in sitemap)
- **Missing from sitemap**: 2 URLs need sitemap updates

#### Horoscope.csv Analysis
- **URLs tested**: 51 redirects
- **URL Accessibility**: 100% (51/51)
- **Sitemap Compliance**: 0% (0/51 in sitemap)
- **Key insight**: All horoscope redirects work but need sitemap implementation

**Action Items Status:**
1. ✅ **Multi-file testing capability implemented**
2. ✅ **Unique report generation per CSV file**
3. ✅ **Critical sitemap issues identified through comprehensive testing**
4. ✅ **Manual verification completed - all issues confirmed genuine**
5. ✅ **Escalation documentation created** (See: SITEMAP_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md)
